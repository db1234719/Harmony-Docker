We have used Jellyfin as the main component to host our media to the world cause it has great media support and does everything we want and unlike plex it's free and open-source!
For Organizing our media library however we will use two piece of component from Servarr stack named Sonarr, Radarr which all it does is rename files to what the Jellyfin desire to show the library as intended!

Please just read the yaml files there is instruction on how to do the docker side.
